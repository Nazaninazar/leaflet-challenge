Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.


### Level 1: Basic Visualization

 visualization of an earthquake data set.

1. ** data set**

   ![3-Data](Images/3-Data.png)

   The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

2. **Import & Visualize the Data**

   Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Created a legend that will provide context for your map data.

   * Visualization should something like the map above.

### Level 2: More Data

Illustrated the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Pulled in a second data set and visualized it along side the original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.

In this step we are going to..

* Plot a second data set on our map.

* Added a number of base maps to choose from as well as separate out our two different data sets into overlays that can be turned on and off independently.

* Add layer controls to our map.

### Assessment
Final product will be assessed on the following metrics:

* Completion of assigned tasks

* Visual appearance

* Professionalism
